Vue Kanban - a Trello Clone
===========================

Vue Kanban is a clone of the popular SCRUM site [Trello](https://trello.com/). Note that Vue Kanban's server is hosted on Heroku on a free server, so your first login/register attempt will merely cause the server to spin up. You'll need to make an attempt and then wait a few seconds before trying again.

Vue Kanban utilizes Boards as collections of Lists, where each List may have a collection of Tasks. Tasks can be dragged and dropped to different Lists. You may add other users to Boards as collaborators if you know their e-mail.

You may register your own account, or use the sample account with the following information:
* dave@dave.com
* sandbox
